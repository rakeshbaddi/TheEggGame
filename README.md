# TheEggGame

The Egg Game using OpenGL Packages:

Developed a game that was simple & mostly resembled the flash game where eggs were caught in the basket as birds laid them. The game was implemented using C language with the help of OpenGL packages.

Note: You will need to install the required OpenGL/CV packages to run the code correctly.
